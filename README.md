## 🚀 **Overview**

This project is a **complete DSA visualization tool** that helps users understand:  
- 🔹 Linear Data Structures: Arrays, Stack, Queue, Linked List (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  
- 🔹 Non-Linear Data Structures: Trees (General, BST, AVL), Graphs  
- 🔹 Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Sorting, Searching  

Features include:  
- 🎨 Animated operations (insert, delete, push, pop, enqueue, dequeue)  
- 🖥️ Multi-language code display (C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript)  
- 📈 Interactive UI with dark/light theme toggle  
- 🧠 Step-by-step explanations of operations  

This webpage is perfect for **students and beginners** to visualize complex DSA concepts in a fun and interactive way.

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

1. **Select a Data Structure**  
   - Users can choose from arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs.  

2. **Perform Operations**  
   - Interactive buttons allow insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.  

3. **Animations**  
   - Each operation is animated to demonstrate real-time changes in the data structure.  

4. **Multi-language Code**  
   - Displays the implementation of operations in multiple programming languages.  

5. **Dark/Light Mode**  
   - Toggle between themes for better readability.
